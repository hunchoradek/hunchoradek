---

Computer Science student with professional experience as a DevOps Engineer and strong foundations in software
development. Actively building skills through personal and academic projects. Currently working at personal growth in DevOps and still mastering my Frontend skills. 

In my free time, I like to tinker with various PC builds, mod the OS including many Linux variations. Currently I'm running Windows 11 on my Desktop PC due to issues with the games I play. I code using WSL2 with VS Code. On the go, I use my laptop (Thinkpad X1 Carbon gen 6) with CachyOS.
